Brief project introduction.
This project involved analyzing user onboarding and engagement in a Media Streaming product using Amplitude Analytics. The project focuses on creating a specific user cohort and building a series of visualizations to understand user behavior at key stages of their journey.

Tasks:
1. Creation of a Specific User Cohort: Cohort Parameters:
* Country: USA
* Platform: iOS and Android
* Condition: Users who first performed the "Welcome" action during June 2023 (using "historical count" for the first execution).
2. Building Visualizations Based on the Cohort:
* Onboarding Funnel:
* Sequence: Welcome -> User Sign Up -> Main Landing Screen -> Search Song or Video -> Play Song or Video.
* Breakdown: By platform (iOS, Android).
* Daily Onboarding Funnel Conversion:
* Visualization of onboarding funnel conversion broken down by day and platform.
* Daily Onboarding Completion Time:
* Chart showing the average time it takes users to complete onboarding, broken down by day and platform.
* Dynamics of Users Performing "Play Song or Video" and "Any Active Event":
* Daily chart of the number of users performing these two event types.
* Average Number of Events Per User (Daily):
* Chart of average daily activity: "Any active event" and "Play Song or Video".
* User Retention Chart:
* User Retention from "Welcome" event to "Any Active Event" and "Play Song or Video".
* Visualization: Bar chart.
3. Dashboard Creation: Combined the cohort and all created charts into a single dashboard.
