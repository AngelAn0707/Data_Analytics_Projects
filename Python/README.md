Project: Analyzing Facebook Ad Campaigns with Pandas and Python

Project Description:
Brief project introduction.
This project involved analyzing Facebook advertising campaign data using the Pandas library in Python and visualization tools. The project's goal was to investigate the dynamics of advertising costs, ROMI, the behavior of individual campaigns, and the relationships between key metrics.

### Задачи:
1. Data Loading:
Loaded the facebook_ads_data.csv file into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. Daily Data Analysis (2021):
Grouped data by day.
Daily Ad Spend Chart: Visualized total_spend for 2021.

4. Analysis by Campaign Name:
Grouped data by campaign name (campaign_name).

Total Ad Spend Chart: Visualized total_spend for each campaign.

5. Box Plot for ROMI:
Created a Box Plot to analyze the spread of daily ROMI for each campaign, allowing for the identification of anomalies or distribution characteristics.

6. ROMI Distribution Histogram:
Constructed a histogram showing the distribution of ROMI values across the entire dataset.

7. Correlation Heatmap:
Created a correlation heatmap between all numerical metrics in facebook_ads_data.csv.
Identified metrics with the highest and lowest correlation.
Determined what total_value correlates most strongly with.

18. Scatter Plot with Linear Regression:
Created a scatter plot with an overlaid linear regression line (lmplot()) to visualize the relationship between total_spend and total_value.
